This part is optional. 

We've built our web application, and containerized it with Docker.
But imagine a team of ML engineers and scientists that needs to maintain, improve and scale this service over time. 
It would be nice to write some tests to ensure we don't regress! 

  1. `Pytest` is a popular testing framework for Python. If you haven't used it before, take a look at https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/getting-started.html to get started and familiarize yourself with this library.
   
  2. How do we test FastAPI applications with Pytest? Glad you asked, here's two resources to help you get started:
    (i) Introduction to testing FastAPI: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing/
    (ii) Testing FastAPI with startup and shutdown events: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/testing-events/
